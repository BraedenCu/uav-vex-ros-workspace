rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

//Adding custom messages to arduino rosserial. I could not get this to work, I just had to delete 
//the ros_lib library from the snap/arduino/50/Arduino/libraries directory. Then I used the following command
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py (insert path to arduino library directory here)
rosrun rosserial_client make_library.py path_to_libraries your_message_package
